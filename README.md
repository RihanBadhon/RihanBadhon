### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rihan Miah Badon
#### Full Stack Web Developer

I'm currently studying at Manitoba Institute of Trade and Technology (MITT). From a young age, my passion for technology has been a driving force in my life, particularly the world of computers and the art of designing user interfaces that are both functional and visually captivating. This enthusiasm led me to MITT, where I'm diligently refining my front-end development skills to bring my vision of immersive digital experiences to life. While my primary focus is on front-end development, I also have a strong interest in and expertise in backend technologies. I'm eager to contribute across all aspects of web development, from front-end to back-end, to create cohesive and dynamic web solutions
